# Carfax-Used-Cars with Compose, Navigation, Coil, Permissions, Hilt, Retrofit, Coroutines using MVVM Architecture

## About
This is a demo application built using modern Jetpack tools that connects to used car listings backend in order
to retrieve and display car listings data.

## Using
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Official programming language for Android development.
- [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. 
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack) - Fully static Dependency injection library for Android.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is an important part of the development landscape.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android,Annotations on the interface methods and its parameters indicate how a request will be handled.
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [Navigation](https://google.github.io/accompanist/navigation-animation/) - A library to handle all your Navigation needs.

## NOTE
- You would need to request a secrets.properties file (and place it at a root level of the project) from Vivek Shah in order to build the project successfully.
- There were some links for showing the images starting with "https://carfax..." which looked broken, so I ended up using a placeholder image for them.
- I wanted to add animations such as Navigation Animations but looked like we were on a tight deadline to couldn't do it but just a FYI!
- I wanted to do some last minute refactoring and code cleanups but couldn't do it due to TIME CONSTRAINTS.
